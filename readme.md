# RSPEC

## Today we was introduced to TDD (test drivin devoplement) using rspec

We created some of our own tests as well as done a small testing lab, learning the syntax and how to compare vaulues and check if they fail. Plus learnt about the red, and green cycle where you make the test so it fails then correct it.
