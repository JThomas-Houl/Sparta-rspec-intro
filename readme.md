# RSPEC

## Test Driven Development (TDD) using rspec

We created some of our own tests as well as done a small testing lab, learning the syntax and how to compare values and check if they fail. Plus learnt about the red, and green cycle where you make the test, so it fails then correct it.

# RSPEC Calculator 

Here you can find the tests for the RSPEC Calculator, these tests consist of checking values can be multiplied, add, subtract and divide.

These all are TDD and was created using the red and green techniques where you create the test before creating the functionality of it.

## Running the tests

To run the test, you must be your terminal, in the directory ``` Sparta-rspec-intro/RSPEC_Calculator``` 

Then run the command ```rspec``` this will check the spec file and then run the tests showing you all should pass the current test cases.
